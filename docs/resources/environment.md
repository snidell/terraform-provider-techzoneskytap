# skytap_environment (Resource)

Provides a Skytap Environment resource. An environment consists of one or more virtual machines, networks, 
and associated settings and metadata. Unlike a template, an environment can be run and have most of its settings 
modified. When an environment is created all of its VMs will be run.

## Example Usage


```hcl
# Create a new environment
resource "skytap_environment" "environment" {
  template_id = "123456"
  name = "Terraform Example"
  description = "Skytap terraform provider example environment."
  tags = ["example"]
}
```

~> **NOTE:** If `suspend_on_idle` and `suspend_at_time` are both null, automatic suspend is disabled.

~> **NOTE:** If `suspend_on_idle` and `suspend_at_time` are both null, automatic suspend is disabled. If `shutdown_on_idle` and `shutdown_at_time` are both null, automatic shut down is disabled.

~> **NOTE:** If `suspend_on_idle` and `suspend_at_time` are both null, automatic suspend is disabled.* An environment cannot be set to automatically suspend and shut down. Only one of the following settings can take effect: `suspend_on_idle`, `suspend_at_time`, `shutdown_on_idle`, or `shutdown_at_time`.

~> **NOTE:** If `suspend_on_idle` and `suspend_at_time` are both null, automatic suspend is disabled. When you send a request that updates one of the four suspend or shutdown options, the other three options are automatically set to null by the REST API.

~> **NOTE:** If `suspend_on_idle` and `suspend_at_time` are both null, automatic suspend is disabled. If multiple suspend or shut down options are sent in the same request, the `suspend_type` field determines which setting Skytap Cloud will honor.
