# skytap_vm (Resource)

Provides a Skytap Virtual Machine (VM) resource. The environment VM resource represents an image of a single virtual machine.

~> **NOTE:**
* VMs do not exist outside of environments or templates.
* An environment or template can have multiple VMs.
* Each VM is a unique resource. Therefore, a VM in a template will have a different ID than a VM in an environment created from that template.
* The VM will be run immediately after creation.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new vm
resource "skytap_vm" "vm" {
  template_id = 1473407
  vm_id = 37865463
  environment_id = "${skytap_environment.environment.id}"
  name = "my vm"
  cpus = 2
  ram = 4096

  os_disk_size = 40000

  disk  {
    name = "my disk"
    size = 4096
  }

  disk  {
      name = "my other disk"
      size = 4096
  }

  network_interface  {
     interface_type = "vmxnet3"
     network_id = "${skytap_network.network.id}"
     ip = "172.128.0.1"
     hostname = "myhost"

    published_service {
      name = "ssh"
      internal_port = 22
    }
  }
}

# Will work after VM resource is created
output "ssh_ip" {
  value = "${skytap_vm.vm.service_ips.ssh}"
}
output "ssh_port" {
  value = "${skytap_vm.vm.service_ports.ssh}"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **environment_id** (String) ID of the environment you want to add the VM to
- **template_id** (String) ID of the template you want to create the VM from
- **vm_id** (String) ID of the VM within the template that you want to create the VM from

### Optional

- **cpus** (Number) Number of CPUs allocated to this virtual machine
- **disk** (Block Set) Set of virtual disks within the VM (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--disk))
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **label** (Block Set) Set of labels for the instance (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--label))
- **name** (String) User-defined name of the VM
- **network_interface** (Block Set) Set of virtualized network interface cards (also known as a network adapters) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--network_interface))
- **os_disk_size** (Number) The size of the OS disk. The disk size is in MiB; it will be converted to GiB in the Skytap UI. The maximum disk size is 2,096,128 MiB (1.999 TiB)
- **ram** (Number) Amount of RAM allocated to the VM
- **timeouts** (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- **user_data** (String) VM user data, available from the metadata server and the Skytap API

### Read-Only

- **max_cpus** (Number) Maximum settable CPUs for the VM
- **max_ram** (Number) Maximum amount of RAM that can be allocated to the VM
- **service_ips** (Map of String) Map of external IP addresses. The key is the name of a published service - as defined in the `published_service` block
- **service_ports** (Map of Number) Map of external IP addresses. The key is the name of a published service - as defined in the `published_service` block

### Nested Schema for `disk`

Required:

- **name** (String) A unique name for the disk
- **size** (Number) The size of the disk specified in MiB. The minimum disk size is 2048 MiB; the maximum is 2,096,128 MiB (1.999 TiB)

Read-Only:

- **controller** (String) The disk controller
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **lun** (String) The logical unit number (LUN) of the disk
- **type** (String) The type of disk


<a id="nestedblock--label"></a>
### Nested Schema for `label`

Required:

- **category** (String) Label category that provides contextual meaning

Read-Only:

- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
