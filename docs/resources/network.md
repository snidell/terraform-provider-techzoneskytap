# skytap_network (Resource)

Provides a Skytap Network resource. Networks are not top-level elements of the Skytap API.
Rather, they are elements properly contained within an environment.
Operations on them are implicitly on the containing environment.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Create a new network
resource "skytap_network" "network" {
  environment_id = "123456"
  name = "my network"
  domain = "domain.com"
  subnet = "1.2.0.0/16"
  gateway = "1.2.3.254"
  tunnelable = true
}
```
